## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Launch hang on Finder/Spotlight start** ([#2](https://github.com/PsychQuant/logos/issues/2))
  — GUI-launched Logos froze on a loading spinner because
  `MainScene.autoLoadWorkspaceIfNeeded` used `FileManager.default.currentDirectoryPath`
  as the default workspace; for GUI processes that path is `/`, so the
  loader recursed the entire filesystem on the main thread.

  Three-prong fix (commits `ed5e839` → `1aa171d` → `f00e8c8`):

  - **`WorkspaceLoader` safety limits** — new `maxDepth` (default 10)
    and `maxFiles` (default 50,000) parameters; absolute-path skip set
    drops any child whose resolved real path matches `/System`, `/Library`,
    `/private`, `/usr`, `/Volumes`, `/dev`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/bin`,
    `/sbin`, `/cores`; root `/` (and entries in the skip set) refused
    outright with `LoaderError.refusedSystemPath`; `LoaderError` gained
    `.tooManyFiles(found:cap:)` for the catastrophic-input defence line.
  - **Async loader + loading state** — `WorkspaceLoader.loadAsync` runs
    the walk in `Task.detached(.userInitiated)` so MainActor stays
    responsive; `WorkspaceModel.openWorkspaceAsync` publishes an
    `isLoading` flag and cancels the previous in-flight load when a new
    call arrives; `MainView` overlays a `ProgressView` on `.thinMaterial`
    while loading.
  - **Last-workspace persistence** — new
    `Sources/Logos/Services/WorkspacePersistence.swift` stores the
    last-opened path in `UserDefaults` under
    `logos.lastWorkspacePath`; `MainScene` reads it on launch (clearing
    stale entries whose path no longer exists) and falls back to a
    welcome empty state when nothing is stored. `cwd` is no longer
    consulted at any point.

  11 new tests; full suite 125/125 pass. Smoke-verified against the
  Developer-ID-signed + notarized v0.1.0 build.

### Known issues

- **Keychain dialog on first-launch credential import**
  ([#3](https://github.com/PsychQuant/logos/issues/3)) — running login
  triggers macOS `找不到鑰匙圈來儲存「<username>」` dialog because
  `SystemKeychainBridge` writes a keychain item under a service / account
  pair owned by the `claude` CLI's signing identity. Workaround: click
  "重置為預設值" once. Tracked separately.
